"I am a biology researcher in need of a fair understanding of linear algebra in order to perform certain bioinformatic analysis'. Out of many text books approached, the pedagogics and visualizations applied in your book was far superior to other sources. I am eternally grateful for you guys sharing this book. Thanks." <br>
