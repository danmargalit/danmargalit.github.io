In 
Spring 2020 it is held 1-2:00 pm on Wednesdays in Skiles 234. 

<p>

The current format is that we decide on a paper the previous week, the members look over the paper, and we then have an informal discussion.  Usually, there is no lecture.

<p>

Recently discussed papers include:
<ul>
<li>Right-angled Artin groups as normal subgroups of mapping class groups, by Clay, Mangahas, and Margalit
<li>Vanishing of the Euler class in Power subgroups of the punctured mapping class group, by Chen
<li>The congruence subgroup problem for pure braid groups: Thurstonâ€™s proof, by McReynolds
<li>Automorphisms of the loop and arc graph of an infinite-type surface, by Schafer-Cohen
<li>Pseudo-Anosov mappings and toral automorphisms, by Kenyon
</ul>
