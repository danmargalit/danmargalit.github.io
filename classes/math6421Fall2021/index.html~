<h2>Homework</h2>
</font>

<ol>
<li>Let C be the affine algebraic variety Z(xy) in A<sup>2</sup>.  Describe the intersection of C with the unit sphere |x|<sup>2</sup>+|y|<sup>2</sup>=1.
<li>Consider the three ideals I<sub>1</sub> = (xy+y<sup>2</sup>,xz+yz) and I<sub>2</sub>=(xy+y<sup>2</sup>,xz+yz+xyz+y<sup>2</sup>) and I<sub>3</sub>=(xy<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>3</sup>,xz+yz).  Are any of these equal?  Do any of them define the same affine algebraic varieties?  Sketch them! <!--Hulek p. 58-->
<li>Consider the affine algebraic variety C=Z(x<sup>2</sup>-yz,xz-x) in A<sup>3</sup>.  Decompose C into its irreducible components.
<li>Consider the semi-cubical parabola C=Z(y<sup>2</sup>-x<sup>3</sup>).  Show that the map from the complex plane to C given by t maps to (t<sup>2</sup>,t<sup>3</sup>) is a homeomorphism in the Zariski topology (here we mean for both to have the Zariski topology).  Is it a homeomorphism with respect to the Euclidean topology?  (We will see that this is not an isomorphism of varieties.)
<li>Is the coordinate ring for the unit circle Z(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>-1)) isomorphic to the coordinate ring for the parabola Z(y-x<sup>2</sup>)?  Hint: Find two factorizations of y<sup>2</sup> in one of the rings...
<li>Prove that subvarieties of an affine algebraic variety X are in bijection with reduced k-subalgebra quotients of k[X].
<li>Prove that the product of two affine algebraic varieties is an affine algebraic variety.
<li>Let X be an affine algebraic variety and suppose that a finite group G acts on X by automorphisms.  We would like to define the quotient variety X/G.  The quotient X/G does not naturally live in affine space, so it is not immediately realized as a variety.  (a) Show that there is an induced action of G on the coordinate ring k[X].  (b) Show that the invariants k[X]<sup>G</sup> of this action is a finitely generated reduced sub-algebra of k[X] (the invariants are the elements that are fixed by every element of G).  (c) Let X' be the (isomorphism class of) affine algebraic varieties corresponding to k[X]<sup>G</sup>.  Show that the points of X' are in bijection with X/G (the set of G-orbits in X).  (d) Show that the quotient map from X to X/G is a quotient map in the Zariski topology (the preimages of a set U in X' = X/G is open iff U is open).  (e) Conclude that X' is a reasonable definition for X/G.
<li>Apply the previous exercise to the standard action of the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> on A<sup>n</sup>.  (a) What are the invariants for the action of S<sub>n</sub> on A<sup>n</sup>?  (b) Show that the map from A<sup>n</sup>/S<sub>n</sub> to A<Sup>n</sup> that takes an unordered set of roots to a polynomial is an isomorphism of varieties.  Assume that k is algebraically closed. 
<li>Show that the rational normal curve of degree 3, parametrized by [t<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup>:t<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>t<sub>1</sub>:t<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>:t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>] is equal to the intersection of three quadrics, namely, Z(xz-y<sup>2</sup>, xw-yz, yw-z<sup>2</sup>).  Show that it is not the intersection of two quadrics. 
<li>Consider Y=Z<sub>p</sub>(xw-yz).  (a) Show that xw-yz is irreducible, and conclude that Y is irreducible.  (b) Show that f : P<sup>2</sup> &rarr; Y given by [x:y:z] &rarr; [x<sup>2</sup>:xy:xz:yz] is a rational map. Show that f is dominant.  (Hint 1: Show that each point [a:b:c:d] with a not equal to zero is in the image. Hint 2: Use/prove the lemma that if a map contains the complement of any subvariety then it is dominant.) (c) Show that g : Y &rarr; P<sup>2</sup> given by [x:y:z:w] &rarr; [x:y:z] is a rational map.  Show that it is dominant.  (d) Show that f and g are birational.  Conclude that Y is rational (meaning that it is birationally equivalent to projective space).
<li>Consider the projective twisted cubic Y=Z<sub>p</sub>(xz-y<sup>2</sup>,yw-z<sup>2</sup>,xw-yz) in P<sup>3</sup>.  (a) Show that f : P<sup>1</sup> &rarr; Y given by [u:v] &rarr; [u<sup>3</sup>:u<sup>2</sup>v:uv<sup>2</sup>:v<sup>3</sup>] is a morphism. (b) Show that f is an isomorphism by finding the inverse rational map and computing their compositions.  Conclude that Y is isomorphic to P<sup>1</sup>
<li>We consider the Grassmannian G(2,4) as the space of lines in P<sup>3</sup>.  The Plucker embedding puts this in P<sup>5</sup>.   Consider two skew lines in P<sup>3</sup>.  Show that the set Q of lines in P<sup>3</sup> meeting both is the intersection of G(2,4) with a 3-plane P<sup>3</sup> in P<sup>5</sup>, and so it is a quadric surface.  Deduce that Q is isomorphic to P<sup>1</sup> x P<sup>1</sup>.  What happens if the two original lines meet?
<li>Let X be an affine algebraic variety.  Show that an injective, finite map k[y<sub>1</sub>,...,y<sub>d</sub>] &rarr; k[X] corresponds to a finite-to-one surjective map X &rarr; A<sup>d</sup>.  Recall that a map of k-algebras f : A &rarr; B is finite if B is a finitely generated module over f(A).  There is a discussion of this in Hulek's book (and many other places).  Explain in your own words.
<li>Prove that the dimension of a hypersurface in A<sup>n</sup> or P<sup>n</sup> is n-1.  Recall that a hypersurface is a variety of the form Z(f) for a polynomial f.  UPDATE: This problem is canceled, because it is harder than I thought it was.  If you want to read about it, it is Geometric Krull’s Hauptidealsatz, which you can find in Dolgachev's book, for example.
<li>For which [a:b] in P<sup>1</sup> is the curve C<sub>[a:b]</sub> = Z((a+b)y<sup>2</sup>-(a+b)x<sup>3</sup>-bx) singular?  Sketch these curves over the reals.  Bonus: Do the same for the projective closure in P<sup>2</sup>.
<li>Find all singular points of the zero sets of the following three polynomials: (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>3</sup>-4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup> in k[x,y], xy<sup>2</sup>-z<sup>2</sup> in k[x,y,z], and xy+x<sup>3</sup>+y<sup>3</sup> in k[x,y,z]
<li>Show that Z(xy-z<sup>2</sup>) in P<sup>2</sup> is nonsingular.  Hint: once you do it for the first affine chart, it suffices to check the points not in that chart. 
<li>Recall that the blowup of an affine variety X along an ideal I=(f<sub>1</sub>,...,f<sub>m</sub>) is the graph of the map X &rarr; P<sup>m-1</sup> sending x to [f<sub>1</sub>(x):...:f<sub>m</sub>(x)].  Show that the blowup of any irreducible affine variety along any principal ideal is an isomorphism.
<li>Show that the blowup of A<sup>2</sup> along (x<sup>2</sup>,y<sup>3</sup>) is not smooth (so blowup can make a variety more singular!).
<li>Show that the blowup of A<sup>3</sup> along any line is smooth (find the defining equations for the blowup).
<li>Find the intersection points and multiplicities: (x+z)<sup>3</sup>+3y<sup>3</sup>-z<sup>3</sup> and x<sup>3</sup>+x<sup>2</sup>(y+z)+xz<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>3</sup>
<li>Find the intersection points and multiplicities: y<sup>2z-x(x-2z)(x+z) and y<sup>2</sup>+x<sup>2</sup>-2xz
<li>Find the intersection points and multiplicities: (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)z+x<sup>3</sup>+y<sup>3</sup> and x<sup>3</sup>+y<sup>3</sup>-2xyz
<li>Show that R(f,g+af)=R(f,g) if deg a = deg g - deg f.  Let C=Z(f), D=Z(g), and E=Z(g+af).  Show that I<sub>p</sub>(C,E) = I<sub>p</sub>(C,D) for all p.
<li>Find explicit formulas for the group law on Z(y<sup>2</sup>x-z<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>3</sup>).  Use [0:1:0] as the identity.
<li>Let f be a polynomial and f' its derivative.  The discriminant of f is Res(f,f').  Compute the discriminant in terms of the coefficients of f (what do you get when deg f = 2?).  Show that the discriminant is 0 exactly at the multiples roots of f.
<li>Use the local ring definition of intersection multiplicity to show that the multiplicity of the intersection of Z(y) and Z(y-x<sup>3</sup>) is 3.
</ol>

<!--
<ol>
<li>Let k be an infinite field.  Show that f,g in k[x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>] are equal if and only if f(a)=g(a) for all a in A<sup>n</sup>.
<li>Let k = Z/pZ where p is prime.  Is the affine space A<sup>n</sup> Hausdorff under the Zariski topology?
<li>Find a compact set in the Zariski topology that is not closed.
<li>Use the Nullstullensatzes to prove the correspondence between radical/prime/maximal ideals of k[X] and general/irreducible/one-point varieties of X.
<li>Show that f<sub>*</sub> : k[Y] &rarr; k[X] is injective if and only if f is dominant, that is, theimage f(X) is dense in Y.
<li>Show that f<sub>*</sub> : k[Y] &rarr; k[X] is surjective if and only f f defines an isomorphism between X and a subvariety of Y.
<li>Prove the uniqueness statement: If f : X &rarr; Y and g : X &rarr; Y are maps with f<sub>*</sub> = g<sub>*</sub> then f=g.
<li>Let X be an affine algebraic variety in A<sup>n</sup> and let k[X] be its coordinate ring, where k is algebraically closed.  For each f in k[X], let U<sub>f</sub> be the set of points p in X so that f(p) is nonzero.  (a) Show that {U<sub>f</sub>} forms a basis for the Zariski topology on X.  (These are called the basic, or principal, open sets.) (b) Prove that X is compact, meaning that every open cover has a finite subcover (in algebraic geometry this condition is usually called quasi-compactness, with the word compact reserved for Hausdorff spaces).  (c) Describe all irreducible Hausdorff affine algebraic varieties in X.
<li>Let V be an affine subspace of A<sup>n</sup> (that is, a translate of a linear subspace).  Give a description of k[V].  Show that the algebro-geometric dimension is equal to the linear-algebraic dimension.  
<li>The twisted cubic is the image of the map P<sup>1</sup> &rarr; P<Sup>3</sup> given by [x<sub>0</sub>:x<sub>1</sub>] &rarr; [x<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup>:x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub>:x<sub>0</sub>x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>:x<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>].  Verify that the twisted cubic is a projective variety.  Hint: use the polynomials z<sub>0</sub>z<sub>2</sub>-z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, z<sub>0</sub>z<sub>3</sub>-z<sub>1</sub>z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>z<sub>3</sub>-z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> in k[z<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>3</sub>].
<li>Show that (i) every element of &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>V is totally decomposable, (ii) every element of &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>V is totally decomposable if dim V = 3, and (iii) if v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub> are linearly independent then v<sub>1</sub> &and; v<sub>2</sub> + v<sub>3</sub> &and; v<sub>4</sub> is not totally decomposable.
<li>Find a set of homogeneous polynomials S so that the image of G<sub>2,4</sub> under the Plucker embedding is Z(S).  What is the smallest such S?  Here is how to do it: Choose a basis e<sub>i</sub> for k<sup>4</sup>.  This gives you 6 basis elements e<sub>I</sub> for &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>V.  Let x be an arbitrary point &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>V; this is given by the 6 a<sub>I</sub>-coordinates.  As in class, there is a matrix M<sub>x</sub> corresponding to &phi;<sub>x</sub>; this should be a 4 x 4 matrix. To say that x is in the image of the Plucker embedding is to say that x is totally decomposable, which is to say (by the Lemma in class) that all 3 x 3 minors vanish.  If you write down the 16 3 x 3 minors, you will get 16 polynomials in the a<sub>I</sub>.  You will see that you can throw most of them away. 
<li>Revisit Exercise 0.2.4(i) in Gathmann.  What does the set of solutions look like in projective space (note that a line in projective space is the image of a plane in affine space)?
<li>Show that the intersection, product, or sum of homogeneous ideals is homogeneous.
<li>Consider the twisted cubic X = Z(y-x<sup>2</sup>,z-xy).  Show that the sub variety of P<sup>3</sup> given by the homogenizations of the defining polynomials for X has two components: the projective closure of X and one additional line.  
<li>Show that the projective completion of an affine variety is the Zariski closure of that variety, thought of as a subset of A<sup>n</sup>, hence as a subset of P<sup>n</sup>.
<li>Show that the projective completion of an irreducible variety is irreducible.
<li>Show that the twisted cubic curve C in A<sup>3</sup> can be defined by the polynomials y-x<sup>2</sup> and z-x<sup>3</sup>, and that these polynomials generate the full radical ideal of polynomials vanishing on C.  Show that the two homogeneous polynomials obtained by homogenizing these polynomials define the projective closure of C in P<sup>3</sup>, but that the ideal they generate is not radical.  
<li>Show that the homogenization of a radical ideal is radical.
<li>Prove that the homogeneous ideal of the set {[1:0:0],[0:1:0]} in P<sup>2</sup> is (x<sub>2</sub>,x<sub>0</sub>x<sub>1</sub>).  Interpret this fact geometrically and then find the homogeneous ideal of the set {[2:3:-1],[1:-2:2]}.  Try to generalize the exercise to sets of 3 and 4 points in P<sup>2</sup> (you will need to think about the different possible embeddings of points).
<li>Show that the Segre embedding &phi;<sub>m,n</sub> maps {linear subspace} x {pt} and {pt} x {linear subspace} to linear subspaces of P<sup>(m+1)(n+1)</sup>.
<li>Define the product of two affine varieties to be the image under the appropriate Segre map.  Show that the product of two affine varieties is an affine variety.
<li>Regard the twisted cubic as the image of the map P<sup>1</sup> &rarr; P<Sup>3</sup> given by [x:y] &rarr; [x<sup>3</sup>:x<sup>2</sup>y:y<sup>2</sup>:y<sup>3</sup>].  Show that the twisted cubic lies in the Segre variety V<sub>1,1</sub>.  Find bihomogeneous polynomials describing the twisted cubic as a subset of P<sup>1</sup> x P<Sup>1</sup>.
<li>Assuming that the Segre map is an isomorphism of P<sup>n</sup> x P<sup>n</sup> onto V<sub>m,n</sub>, show that the diagonal in P<sup>n</sup> x P<Sup>n</sup> is a closed set.
<li>Define the topology on a product of varieties by declaring the Segre map to be an isomorphism of P<sup>n</sup> x P<sup>n</sup> onto V<sub>m,n</sub>.  Show that the induced topology is not the product topology, assuming that neither of the varieties in the product is a finite collection of points.
<li>Consider the Veronese map &nu;<sub>2</sub> : P<sup>2</sup> &rarr; P<sup>5</sup>.  Its image is called the Veronese surface.  Describe the images of the lines in P<sup>2</sup> in the Veronese surface.
<li>Verify the defining equations for the images of the Veronese maps.
<li>Prove the classification of conics in P<sup>2</sup>.
<li>Consider the curve in A<sup>2</sup> given by y<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>3</sup>+ax+b, where a and b lie in k.  Find conditions on a and b that determine whether or not the given curve is smooth.
<li>Assume that f and g are coprime elements of k[x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>] and let V=Z(fg).  Show that a point of V is singular if and only if it is a singular point of Z(f), Z(g), or their intersection.  
<li>Show that a morphism of affine algebraic varieties induces a linear map on each tangent space.
<li>Describe Spec <b>R</b>[x].
<li>Let R = <b>C</b>[x,y].  (a) Show that (x-y) is a prime ideal in R, and hence is a point in Spec R.  (b) For two fixed complex numbers a and b, show that (x-a,y-b) is a maximal ideal in R and hence is also a point in Spec R.  (c) For every complex number a, the ideal (x-a,y-a) contains the ideal (x-y).  (d) Comment on this. 
<li>Determine Spec <b>Q</b>[x] as a set.
<li>Show that the only non-principal prime ideals in <b>C</b>[x,y] are of the form (x-a,y-b).  Hint: suppose p is not principal.  Show you can find f,g in p with no common factor.  Using the Euclidean algorithm in the Euclidean domain <b>C</b>(x)[y], show that you can find a nonzero h in (f,g) < p.  Using primality, show that one of the linear factors of h, say x-a, is in p.  Similarly show there is some y-b in p.
<li>Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset.  Describe an order-preserving bijection between the primes of S<sup>-1</sup>R and the primes of R that don't meet S.
