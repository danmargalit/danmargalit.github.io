<h3>Lecture and studios</h3>

<p>
  This course will generally consist of two 50-minute lectures and one 50-minute
  studio section per week, at the times listed on your instructor's syllabus.  
  During lectures, we
  will go over the course material as found in the textbook, work examples, and
  answer your (hopefully) many questions.  Please do not use electronic devices
  during lecture unless instructed to do so.
</p>

<p>
  During studio, you will spend time working on problems in groups, going over
  problems with your teaching assistant, taking quizzes, and further discussing
  course material.  You will also take the midterms in studio section.
</p>

<p>
  Attendance is required at all lectures and studio sections.  Classroom
  polling questions and quizzes in section both count toward
  your <a href="#grading">final grade</a>.  You must attend your assigned
  section &mdash; your attendance in a different section will not be counted.
</p>

<h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>
  There will generally be a quiz during each studio section, except
  when there is a midterm.  Quizzes are 10 minutes each.  Typically (but 
not always!), quizzes will cover the material that was done
  in the previous week in lecture (that is, what was covered 9 days and 11 days before in lecture).  Quizzes also
  serve as practice for the exams.  The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
</p>

<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>

<p>
  We will be using Piazza for online class discussion. The system is designed to
  get you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and the instructor.  
  <!-- We will check Piazza regularly.-->   Rather than emailing questions to the teaching
  staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and attend office hours.  You can access
  Piazza through Canvas.
  <!-- <a href="https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-6800-c1dc-588b-8c3b-e0da2bc50950">T-Square</a>. -->
</p>

<h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>
  Your instructor will use Piazza or Canvas (or both) to post announcements.
  It is important that you read the announcements!   <em>Note that you
  will not receive announcement emails from Piazza until you login for the first
  time!</em>
</p>

<h3>Participation</h3>

<p>
  We will do classroom polling through Piazza in lecture, so bring a computer or
  smartphone to class with you.  Responding to these questions counts toward
  your final grade &mdash; although it doesn't matter if your answer was
  correct.  The lowest three poll scores will be dropped.  <em>Please do not use
  your electronic devices when not responding to a poll.</em>
</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>
  Homework will be assigned online and will consist of exercises in
  WeBWorK (accessed through Canvas).
  <!-- <a href="https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-6800-c1dc-588b-8c3b-e0da2bc50950">T-Square</a>).-->
  You are
  responsible for understanding how to solve all homework exercises for exams
  and quizzes.  Homework assignments will generally be due at <strong>11:59 PM on
  Thursdays</strong>.  During the first week of class, there is an 
ungraded practice "Warmup" assignment on 
  WeBWorK designed to get students accustomed to working with the system.<br><br>  The lowest two homework grades will be dropped.  No late
  homework will be accepted &mdash; no exceptions.  Each homework assignment
  counts the same amount toward your grade.  Sometimes multiple homework assignments will be due the same week.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the quiz in studio section may sometimes be based closely on the
  homework that was due the very same week.
</p>


<h3>WeBWorK tips</h3>

<p>
  If you get a funny error message when clicking the WeBWorK tab in Canvas,
  try closing the window and trying again.  Like many other Georgia Tech
  websites, the authentication procedure sometimes requires two attempts to login.
  Other permission denied errors may be solved by deleting your browsers'
  cookies for the gatech.edu domain.
</p>


<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>
  There are three midterm examinations during the semester.  Their dates can be
  found on the <a href="2020s-schedule.html">calendar</a>.  No books, 
notes, calculators, cell phones, or
  other electronic devices are allowed during exams.  Each exam will be worth
  15% of your final grade.
</p>

<h3> Missed work </h3>
<p>
  Absences from quizzes and midterms are generally excused only for Georgia Tech
  official business, religious holidays, serious illness, and the like.  Absences for 
  religious holidays and university
  travel should be discussed with your instructor by Wednesday, August 28.  
  We reserve the right to ask for a
  letter from the Dean of Students to justify an absence.  In the event that you
  miss the midterm for an acceptable reason, you will be able to take a makeup exam
  on the Monday immediately following the midterm.   If this is not possible, then the weight
  of that midterm will be shifted equally to your remaining exams, including the final exam.

<!-- 
You may only make up missed quizzes or exams in the following circumstances. <br><br>
1. University-mandated travel: If you will miss any class days (including studio) for university-mandated travel,
you must give official notice for all of them to your instructor by the end of class on Wednesday, August 30.<br><br>
2. Religious holiday: By the end of class on Wednesday, August 30, you must notify your instructor and your TA of any classes
(including studio) you will miss due to religious holidays. <br><br>
3. Illness: Except under extenuating circumstances, you must notify your TA in advance and have a doctor's note.<br><br>
4. In case of a family emergency, please have your academic advisor or the Dean's office contact your instructor. <br><br>
Otherwise missed quizzes and missed exams result in a 0.
If you will miss an exam, then you must notify your instructor in advance (rather than your TA) and present a doctor's note in
the case of an illness.  <br><br>
In the case of university-mandated travel, you may take a makeup quiz or exam. If you have an excused absence for an exam, then you may take a makeup
exam on the Monday immediately following the exam.  If this is not possible, then the weight
of that exam will be shifted equally to your remaining exams, including the final exam.
-->
</p>

<h3>Final exam</h3>

<p>
  The final exam will cover all course materials and will be administered on the
  date and time set by the Institute, namely, on Tuesday, April 28, from
  6:00 &ndash; 8:50 PM.
</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>
  Your numerical grades on quizzes and exams will be posted throughout the semester
 on Canvas.  When receiving a graded quiz or exam in studio, check to be sure it matches
 the grade posted on Canvas. <br><br> 
  The grading breakdown is as follows. 
  <!--<a href="https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-6800-c1dc-588b-8c3b-e0da2bc50950">T-Square</a>-->

<p>
  <em>  <font color="red"> We have a partial grade replacement policy as follows:
  If you score higher on your final exam than on one of the 
  midterms, then your lowest midterm will count for 7.5% of your grade and the final exam
  will count for 37.5% of your overall grade. 
  However, any student who is found guilty of academic misconduct of any kind in Math 1553
  during the semester is ineligible for this grade replacement policy.  The
  grade replacement policy is
  meant as a good-faith policy for honest students who underperformed 
  on an exam,
  not as a way to help the grades of students who have committed academic misconduct.
  </font>
  </em>
</p>

<h3>Grading cutoffs</h3>

<p>
  Final letter grades will be calculated as follows:
</p>

<p>
  
  After <em> all </em> grades are in and all overall percentage scores for students have 
  been computed, grades are assigned. The standard cutoffs are as follows. 
<p class="text-center">
   <strong>A</strong>: [90%&ndash;100%],
   <strong>B</strong>: [80%&ndash;90%),
   <strong>C</strong>: [70%&ndash;80%),
   <strong>D</strong>: [60%&ndash;70%),
   <strong>F</strong>: [0%&ndash;60%)
</p>

So, to guarantee an A, get 90% or better overall.  (90 means 90, not 89.9)  

To guarantee at least a B grade, get 80% or better overall, etc.

These cutoffs <em> might </em> be adjusted, but only in the downward direction (to make letter grades higher). 
</p>

<p>
Progress report grades will be assigned on September 30.  A satisfactory grade
will be assigned to all students who tentatively have a C or higher as determined by their    
instructor.
</p>

<h3>Extra credit</h3>

<p>
  There is no extra credit.  
</p>

<h3>Honor code</h3>

<p>
  Students are expected to fully adhere to Georgia
  Tech's <a href="http://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code">honor code</a>.
