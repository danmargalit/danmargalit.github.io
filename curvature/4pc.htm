As seen in the <a href=n.gif">demo</a>, two points approaching a point between them is sufficient to determine the circle of curvature.  It is an old theorem that three points uniquely determine a circle.  Leibniz thought that at least four points in an infinitely small part of a curve always lay on a circle, and thus the osculating circle had four-point contact with the curve.  He was wrong.
