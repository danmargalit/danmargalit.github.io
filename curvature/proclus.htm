Proclus was one of the last in line in the "golden chain of Platonic succession."  "Proclus, the successor of Syrianus, at the Athenian school, wrote a commentary on Euclid's Elements.  We possess only that on the first book, which is valuable for the information it contains on the history of geometry" (Cajori 61).
