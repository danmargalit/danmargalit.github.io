A tautochone is a path in a vertical placesuch that a point falling from any height on this path always takes the same amount of time to get to the bottom.  The cycloid is a tautochrone:<BR>

If the above curve was fashioned out of solid material and a marble placed at any point on it, then it would take the marble the exact same time (t seconds) to roll to the bottom vertex no matter where it started from (barring friction, air resistance, ...)  Therefore, if the marble were allowed to rock back and forth on the track, it would hit the bottom every t seconds and thus be an accurate clock.  Huygens' idea was to make a <A HREF="pendulum.htm">pendulum</A> so that the bob would be forced to travel in a tautochronal path without actually sliding on one.  This creates the same effect.
