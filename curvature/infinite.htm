The radius of curvature of a straight line is infinite in the sense that as a circle gets bigger and bigger, it looks more and more like a straight line at a local level--much in the way that the Earth appears flat.  This would imply that the curvature of a straight line is 0, which is the case.  In complex analisis, straight lines are sometimes thought of as lines through the "point" infinity.
