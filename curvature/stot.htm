"Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), the systematizer of deductive logic, though not a professed mathematician, promoted the science of geometry by improving some of the most difficult definitions.  His <I>Physics</I> contains passages with suggestive hints of the principle of virtual velocities.  About his time there appeared a work called <I>Mechanica</I>, of which he is regarded by some as the author.  Mechanics was totally neglected by the Platonic school" (Cajori 34).
