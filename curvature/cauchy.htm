Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was born in Paris, France, and was educated by his father during his early hears.  He then studied at the Ecole Centrale du Pantheon, where he did exceedingly well in ancient classical studies.  He entered the Polytechnic school in 1805 and the Ecole des Ponts et Chausses in 1807.  He became an engineer in 1810.  A few years later, he gave up that nonsense and took up pure science.  From that time, he developed many new ideas.  He made contributions to the theory of light and mechanics, he made great strides in complex analysis, and founded calculus in its modern form.<BR>
