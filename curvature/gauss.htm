Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was born in Brunswick, Germany, as the son of a manual laborer.  At an early age, the Duke of Brunswick recognized his genius and took over his education.  Thereafter, Gauss led an academic life.  From 1795 to 1798, he studied at Gottingen, and in 1799 he got a Doctorate degree at Helmstedt.  He is known for important work in differential geometry.  One of his prized accomplishments was the invention of the Gauss Map, a two-dimensional extension of <A HREF="euler.gif">Euler's map</A>.<BR>
