<h2> Lodging </h2>

<p> There are two major hotels serving Hyde Park. 
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://chicagosouthuniversity.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html", target=_blank>The Hyatt</a> on 53rd street is a 25 minute walk from Eckhart Hall. There is a complimentary shuttle service to campus. 
  It is located near many restaurants and has easy access to transit.  For the conference rate of $235 call (773) 752-5300 (then press 3) and use the code “No Boundaries Conference.”
  <p>
    <li> <a href="http://www.laquintachicagolakeshore.com/", target=_blank>The La Quinta</a> on Lake Shore Drive is a 35 minute walk from Eckhart Hall. It has easy access to the lakefront.  For the conference rate of $164 call (773) 324-3000 and use the code “No Boundaries Conference.”
</ul>
<p> In addition to the hotels, there are many <a href="http://www.airbnb.com", target=_blank>Airbnb</a> rooms available in the neighborhood, which can often be cheaper and located closer to campus.  Please note that it will not be possible to have Airbnb expenses reimbursed though the conference.

<h2> Travel/Transit </h2>

<h3> Airports </h3>
There are two airports serving Chicago.
<ul>
<li> Midway Airport is much closer to Hyde Park. Southwest Airlines flies exclusively to Midway. 
  The number 55 bus connects Hyde Park and Midway. If taking the bus from Hyde Park to Midway, 
  be sure to board a 55 that says "55 to Midway" as opposed to "55 to St. Louis"; the latter will 
  not take you all the way to Midway. All buses from Midway will go to Hyde Park. Uber/Lyft fare 
  from Midway to Hyde Park will be under $30. Budget one hour to travel to Midway by bus, or less by car, depending on traffic.
  <p>
<li> O'Hare Airport is Chicago's primary airport, but it is substantially farther from Hyde Park. 
  To reach Hyde Park from O'Hare, take the CTA Blue Line from O'Hare into downtown, and get off 
  at the Jackson stop. Walk one block east to State Street, and get the number 6 bus ("Jackson 
  Park Express to 79th St."), which will take you in to Hyde Park. Uber/Lyft fare from O'Hare will be $60 or more. 
  Budget two hours to travel to O'Hare by transit, or less by car - but be aware that traffic out to O'Hare can often be terrible.


</ul>
<h3> CTA </h3>
The CTA is Chicago's public transit system, encompassing buses and trains ("the El"). 
If you are planning on using transit at all while in Chicago, you are strongly encouraged to acquire a <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/", target=_blank>Ventra card</a>. 
This will store your fares, make boarding much quicker, and allow you to make transfers at a discount or for free. 
If you plan on exploring Chicago from Hyde Park, the following CTA routes will be useful.
<ul>
  <li> The 6 bus runs along the eastern edge of Hyde Park and runs express between Hyde Park and downtown. <p>
      <li> The Red Line runs north/south all the way up to the northern edge of Chicago (if heading north, look for trains to Howard). 
	To access the Red Line from Hyde Park, take the 55 bus to the Garfield Red Line stop. Returning to Hyde Park via the Red Line is not recommended late 
	at night, since the bus stop is not in the safest neighborhood. Instead, switch to the 6 bus downtown at the Jackson stop. <p>
	  <li> The Metra is a commuter rail line that serves Hyde Park via the South Shore Line. It can take you into downtown very quickly, 
	    but it is slightly more expensive than the bus/El. In addition, the <a href="https://metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/ME/stations/SOUTHSHORE", target=_blank>Metra schedule</a> should always be consulted ahead of time, since it does not run at regular intervals like the El.
	    </ul>

<h2> Hyde Park </h2>

<h3> About Hyde Park </h3>
The University of Chicago is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago's South Side. 
The approximate boundaries are the lake to the east, Washington Park to the west, 61st street to the south, and 47th street to the north.
When exploring on foot, it is not recommended to venture substantially beyond these lines, as some nearby neighborhoods are less safe.
Jackson Park is the large park on the southeastern edge of the neighborhood. It is home to the Museum of Science and Industry, and was the 
site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition. It is well worth a trip.<p>

<h3> Dining </h3>

Benson would revoke the author's Ph.D. if he did not mention Harold's Chicken Shack at 53rd and Woodlawn.<p>

For lunch, there is a range of options just east of campus on 57th street between Kimbark and Kenwood. Z&H and Cemitas Pueblas are particularly recommended.
On campus, there are often food trucks on either side of the quad, on University and Ellis. There is also a café in the basement of Sloane Hall ("Div School") at the southwest end of the quad. <p>

Plein Aire Café at 58th and Woodlawn serves excellent coffee and food - be aware that the line is often quite long. <p>

Slightly farther afield, there is a range of restaurants on 53rd street between Kenwood and Harper. The entirety of Hyde Park's Asian food can be found on 55th street just east of the Metra tracks. <p>

<h3> Bars </h3>
The UChicago Pub located in the basement of Noyes Hall on campus has the best selection of beers in the neighborhood, 
but you must be accompanied by a member (e.g. a current grad student) and pay a $3 cover.<p>

Jimmy's is located at 55th and Woodlawn; for unknown reasons the sign says "Woodlawn Tap". Cash only. <p>

The Cove is located at 55th and Everett adjacent to the lakefront. Better beer selection than Jimmy's with more lighting. Cash only.
